# SpeechModelData
This repository contains useful information and files for modeling speech production and speech acquisition.

*VTL* refers to [*VocalTractLab*](http://vocaltractlab.de/index.php?page=vocaltractlab-features), an articulatory speech synthesizer developed by Peter Birkholz.

**VTL_speakers** contains speaker files for VTL that model speakers of different ages and genders. They have been created and are being further developed by Philip Zurbuchen.

Gestural scores for articulating an extensive list of German syllables within VTL have been created by Bernd Kr√∂ger and can be found [here](http://www.phonetik.phoniatrie.rwth-aachen.de/bkroeger/research.htm#mentalSyllabary).
